# React-Native Boilerplate

Steps to start with this:

- git clone https://github.com/jainniket/albums.git
- cd albums && npm install
- react-native run ios
- Username & Password - `Abcd@gmail.com`, `abcd123`

Features:
- redux-saga for async calls
- reselect and immutableJS for state
- code modularisation (container and component wise logic separated as modules and tested independently)
- tried implementing async loading of modules but couldnâ€™t finish it completely (Due to which Routes file might look messed up but we can improve it)
- configured eslint as per the best practices of Facebook, Ignite and AirBnb
- included one test case for an action (shall include test cases for each component, saga, reducer, action and selector)
- hot and live reloadings are configured
